I enjoy reading books. My favourite book is 'Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint' co-written by a married couple 'Sing syong'; I have read this book many times; but it hasn't bored me a single time, and rereading this story reminds me that there are things I still didn't know about this story, it is like I can see more than just what the author wanted me to see.
I came across this book on a website called lightnovelpub
My favourite character is Kim Dokja (the main character), I like him because of his shrewdness and exploits, and I love his willingness to sacrifice himself for his companions.

ORV has imaginative descriptions and an intriguing plotline, but it is challenging to summarize as it contains multiple layers.
It is a story about the end of the world, in which interdimensional creatures use humanity's destruction as entertainment.
It is a story about a time-travelling, regressing man who relives the end of the world many times and strives to break the cycle.
It is a story about an obsessed reader who has complete knowledge of the previous two stories but is abruptly thrown in the midst of them by unseen powers and now wants to change the ending.
This story is told from the reader's perspective, who grows stronger mentally and physically by facing hardships with the protagonist.
The author intentionally wrote the novel as a meta-narrative. A meta-narrative is a narrative account that experiments with or explores the idea of storytelling and cultural mythology.

ORV has taught me that there's no point in wondering what would happen if you go back in time to fix old mistakes; just learn to live with it, even if the result of your hard work is not what you wanted, do not think that you have failed.
Selfless actions can be very selfish. Putting yourself in harm's way to protect others can bring out even more pain, both from the act, the result and the reason behind it.
